# Weather App


### About

</br>

App created during Henry's bootcamp to practice __ReactJS__ and __React-Router__ for Frontend Development. Using the [OpenWeather API](http://www.omdbapi.com/) I created a SPA (single page application) that works like a bulletin board and allows a user to:

* Search for a city and it's weather, and pin it's card to the board.
* Add the country to the search query (for example, "London, US") to get the city that is actually being looked for.
* Unpin the city's card from the board.
* See the city's details to get more information about it's weather.

</br>

### Result

</br>

The end result is deployed in __Vercel__ and can be accessed through the [Weather App URI](https://weather-app-fbonino.vercel.app).
